"""Utility package for functional tests in Marnie's Maintenance Manager.

This package contains various modules with utility functions and constants
used across functional tests. It provides tools for browser interactions,
date handling, navigation, job management, and test workflows.

Modules in this package should be imported directly, rather than through
this __init__ file, to avoid circular import issues.
