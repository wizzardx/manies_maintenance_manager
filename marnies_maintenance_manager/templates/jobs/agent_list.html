  <h1>Agents</h1>
  <p>This page contains a list of Property Agents registered in the system.</p>
  <p>You can click on the Property Agent to see the Maintenance Jobs that each of them registered.</p>
  <p>
    This is meant to simulate the idea that each Agent (and the company they represent) has their own "spreadsheet".
  </p>
  <ul>
    {% for agent in agent_list %}<li>{{ agent.username }}</li>{% endfor %}
